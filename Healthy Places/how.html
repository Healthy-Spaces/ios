        <h1>How This Study Works</h1>
        <p>With Healthy Places, we want to better understand how you interact with your urban environment and how your exposures may vary depending on your locations and behaviours.  The Healthy Places app collects location data from the GPS in your phone on a regular basis during the day (approximately every 15 minutes). If you allow, the app will also access data in your Health Kit, including physical activity and acceleromter data. In addition, the app will ask you several survey questions at the beginning of the study and on each day of the study (a one week period).</p>
        <p>With this information we hope to better understand your experiences and how these shape your exposures (both positively and negatively). Sharing location and survey data with us is voluntary, you can choose to turn data gathering on or off in the settings menu at any time. No data will be collected or stored on your phone while the data sharing option is turned to off.</p>
        <p>We will share information gained from our study back to you. For example, how your green space exposure compares to others in your city.</p>
