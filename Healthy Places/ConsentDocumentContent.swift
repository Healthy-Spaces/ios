// MARK: - Overview
let overviewSummary         = "Welcome to Healthy Places, the research app for evaluating how your environment influences your health."
let overviewContent         = "The first “module” of Healthy Places focuses on urban green space, which has been correlated with a number of positive health outcomes in research studies. There are many natural or ‘green’ objects in cities, including parks, trees, bushes, open spaces and grass. This green space can reduce noise, air pollution or heat exposures, promote physical activity, increase social connections and reduce stress. \n\nPeople are exposed to and interact with green space in very different ways. The information gained from the Healthy Places Green Space module will help researchers further explore the relationships between green space and health and aid city planners to use green space in ways that are most likely to improve health."

// MARK: - Data Gathering
let dataGatheringSummary    = "With Healthy Places, we want to better understand how you interact with your environment and how your exposures may vary depending on your locations and behaviours."
let dataGatheringContent    = "If you allow, the Healthy Places app will collect location data from the GPS in your phone on a regular basis during the day (approximately every 15 minutes). This data is central to estimating the environmental characteristics you experience in your day-to-day activities and how these may influence your health. The app will also access data in your Health Kit, including physical activity and acceleromter data. \n\nIn addition, the app will ask you several survey questions at the beginning of the study and on each day of the study (a one week period). With these questions we hope to better understand your experiences and how these shape your exposures (both positively and negatively). \n\nSharing location and survey data with us is voluntary, you can choose to turn data gathering on or off in the settings menu at any time. No data will be collected or stored on your phone while the data sharing option is turned off. We will share information gained from our study back to you. For example, how your green space exposure compares to others in your city."

// MARK: - Privacy
let privacySummary          = "Any data you chose to share with us will be stored on a secure server.  Data sent from your phone will be encrypted, but it is important to highlight that any data sent from a wifi or cellular network could be intercepted."

// MARK: - Data Use
let dataUseSummary          = "IIn the settings menu, you can choose to share data with Oregon State University, with Oregon State University and our research partners, or not share your data.  Any data you share with us will only be available for non-profit research purposes.  Our inention is to use the collected data in research to better understand the relationship between environmental exposures and human health."
let dataUseContent          = ""

// MARK: - Time Commitment
let timeCommitmentSummary   = "With the Healthy Places app each research module will require one week of data collection. At the beginning of the study you will complete a baseline questionnaire that will take between 10-20 minutes. We also hope you will share your daily environment experiences with us by answering several short survey questions each day. We anticipate these questions should take less than 5 minutes per day."

// MARK: - Study Survey
let studySurveySummary      = "Survey questions will ask you to rate several aspects of your environment, your use of environmental features, your perceptions of environmental features and potential health impacts/benefits."

// MARK: - Study Tasks
let studyTasksSummary       = "Once you download the Healthy Places app and agree to participate in the study you will be asked to run the app for one week. During this time GPS will be activated and you will receive short daily surveys. We would also like you to participate for another week at another point in the year to examine seasonal differences, but this is voluntary."

// MARK: - Withdrawing
let withdrawingSummary      = "You are free to withdraw from the Healthy Places study at any time.  To withdraw from the study, click the withdraw button in the settings menu.  You can also disable data gathering and data sharing temporarily by turing the data sharing options to off in the settings menu.  You can always turn data sharing back on in the future."
let withdrawingContent      = ""

// Potential Benefits
let benefitsSummary         = "We will provide information on your environmental exposures back to you. For example, using your GPS location we will estimate exposures (e.g. your daily exposure to air pollution or green space) and provide a comparison of your exposures to others in your city. We will also provide ways in which you can improve your exposures."
let benefitsContent         = ""

// Potential Harm
let harmSummary             = "We will collect location information that could be used to identify you.  We will encrypt all app data and store the data on secure servers but we cannot guarantee your anonymity."
