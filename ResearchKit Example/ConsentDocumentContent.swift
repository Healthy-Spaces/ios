// MARK: - Overview
let overviewSummary         = "Welcome to Healthy Places, the research app for evaluating urban environments and how they are related to human health. Exposures related to where you live in a city include air pollution, noise, or green space to name a few and can have important implications for your health.  "
let overviewContent         = "The first “module” of Healthy Places specifically focuses on urban green space, which has recently been correlated with a number of positive health outcomes in research studies. There are many natural or ‘green’ objects in cities, including parks, trees, bushes, open spaces and grass. This green space can reduce noise, air pollution or heat exposures, promote physical activity, increase social activity and reduce stress. However, people are exposed to and interact with green space in very different ways and we currently know little about how green space actually influences health. The information gained from the Green Space and Health module will help researchers and city planners use green space in ways that are most likely to improve the quality of life for those who live, work, or play in urban environments"

// MARK: - Data Gathering
let dataGatheringSummary    = "With Healthy Places, we want to better understand how you interact with your urban environment and how your exposures may vary depending on your locations and behaviours."
let dataGatheringContent    = "The Healthy Places app collects location data from the GPS in your phone on a regular basis during the day (approximately every 15 minutes). If you allow, the app will also access data in the Health app, including physical activity and acceleromter data. In addition, the app will ask you several survey questions at the beginning of the study and on each day of the study (a one week period). With these questions we hope to better understand your experiences and how these shape your exposures (both positively and negatively). Sharing location and survey data with us is voluntary, you can choose to turn data gathering on or off in the settings menu at any time. No data will be collected or stored on your phone while the data sharing option is turned to off. We will share information gained from our study back to you. For example, how your green space exposure compares to others in your city. "

// MARK: - Privacy
let privacySummary          = "Any data you choose to share with us will be stored on a secure server.  Although data you share with us will be encrypted before sending it to us from your phone, any data sent from a wifi or cellular network could be intercepted. The Healthy Places app will not ask for or collect personal identifying information such as your name or date of birth, rather you will be assigned a random id number for research purposes."

// MARK: - Data Use
let dataUseSummary          = "In the settings menu, you can choose to share data with Oregon State University, with Oregon State University and our research partners, or to not share your data.  Any data you share with us will only be available for non-profit research.  Our intention is to use the collected data in research to better understand the relationship between urban environments and human health."

// MARK: - Time Commitment
let timeCommitmentSummary   = "With the Healthy Places app each research module will require one week of data collection. We hope you will share your urban environment experiences with us by answering several short survey questions each day. We anticipate these questions should take less than 5 minutes per day.  "

// MARK: - Study Tasks
let studyTasksSummary       = "Once you download the Healthy Places app and agree to participate in the study you will be asked to run the app for one week. During this time GPS will be activated and you will receive short daily surveys. We would also like you to participate for another week at another point in the year to examine seasonal differences, but this is voluntary."

// MARK: - Study Survey
let studySurveySummary      = "Survey questions will ask you to rate several aspects of your environment, your use of environmental features, your perceptions of environmental features and potential health impacts/benefits."

// MARK: - Withdrawing
let withdrawingSummary      = "You are free to withdraw from the Healthy Places study at any time.  To withdraw from the study, click the withdraw button in the settings menu.  You can also disable data gathering and data sharing temporarily by turing the data sharing options to off in the settings menu.  You can always turn data sharing back on in the future."
